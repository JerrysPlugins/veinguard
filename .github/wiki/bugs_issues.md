# Bugs & Issues

VeinGuard strives to provide a stable and reliable experience, but no plugin is perfect.  
You may encounter bugs, unexpected behavior, or compatibility issues with certain Minecraft versions or server wrappers.

---

## Common Causes

- Using Minecraft versions older than **1.21** (VeinGuard 1.1.2+ supports 1.21+ only).
- Running an unsupported server wrapper or outdated Spigot/Paper/Bukkit version.
- Conflicts with other plugins that modify block breaking or player events.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience a bug or unexpected behavior:

1. **Check the console and logs** for errors related to VeinGuard.
2. **Verify your plugin version** and server version.
3. **Visit the GitHub Issue Tracker**:  
   [VeinGuard Issue Tracker](https://github.com/JerrysPlugins/veinguard/issues)

When reporting an issue, provide:

- Server version (e.g., Paper 1.21.1)
- VeinGuard version (e.g., 1.1.2)
- A detailed description of the bug or error
- Any relevant error logs or screenshots

## Tips for Avoiding Issues

- Always keep **VeinGuard and your server software updated**.
- Test new versions in a **staging or test server** before applying to your main server.
- Avoid installing conflicting plugins that modify block breaking or tracking mechanics.
